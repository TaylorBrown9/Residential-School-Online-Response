After looking through the data collected and displayed by Ryan Pickering I noticed that the data time range was 2004 to present (2015). 
After analyzing the data that was given in the graph showing "Interest Over Time" of four different possible Google searches on the topic of Residential Schools, I noticed that each October beginning in 2013 had a slight increase from the months before leading to larger increases in recent years.
I then went to Google Trends and conducted by own research using their statistics to see data collected from 2013 to present on the searches of "Orange Shirt Day" which began in October 2013 as a tribute to those affected by the residential schooling system. 
Orange Shirt Day is something that may be impacting the amount of searches on the topic of Residential Schools and should also be included in the data. 

The data that I found using Google Trends on the amount of searches for Orange Shirt Day in Canada is as follows,,,
