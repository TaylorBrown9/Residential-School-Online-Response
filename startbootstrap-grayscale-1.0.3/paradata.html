                <p>This project was made for HIST3907B, Data Mining and Visualization with Dr. Shawn Graham at Carleton University. This website represents the culmination of my work in that course and how I have applied digital methodologies in order to do new historical research.</p>
<p>My project on residential schools was intended to examine public consciousness around residential schools through how people were searching for them on Google. While this was a simple approach, using it allowed me to uncover interesting patterns.</p>

                <h2>Tools</h2>
<p>As I said above, the tool I used for this project was Google Trends. Google Trends is a feature provided by Google that allows a user to explore search trends over a period of time, beginning in 2004. While it appears that Google attempts to market it to average users with examples such as search patterns on Game of Thrones, it has become an interesting tool for historical analysis.</p>
<p>Along with discussions in class, I was inspired to use Google Trends to explore public historical consciousness by Shawn Anctil and Ian Milligan. Shawn Anctil is a PhD student in Public and Digital Histories at Carleton, and he has done lots of work with Google Trends - his Twitter can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnanctil">here.</a> Additionally, Ian Milligan wrote about using Google Trends to explore Canadian public consciousness as related to the War of 1812 and commemoration in general - that piece may be found <a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2012/11/07/canadian-history-and-google-trends/">here.</a> These two historians use Google Trends to explore history in unique and illuminating ways, and in my project I tried to evoke some of what they were doing.</p>
<p>Google Trends as a tool is hard to use due to it's normalization of data. A historian cannot access the raw search data that Google uses for their Trends visualizations, but instead normalizes that data as a value from 0 to 100. The highest relative searches in an area or at a certain time are given the value 100 and all others are assigned values according to their closeness to that. This makes using Google Trends problematic, as Google's algorithms are in control of delegating another level of artificial labels to the data, obscuring what can be discovered with it. For example, in my project I noted that it looked like the Northwest Territories had the highest number of searches about residential schools, when in reality that visualization was most likely from their small population and relatively high Indigenous population. However, this normalization makes the data easy for the average user to engage with and allows for easy manipulation and visualization. The graphs created through Google Trends would not have been as user-friendly or aesthetically pleasing if they were encumbered with huge values that varied greatly. In this sense, I am appreciative of the normalization process, though it would be useful as well to compare these normalized values to the raw search data.</p>

                    <P>In terms of the actual project, I felt that it all came together very solidly. Patterns emerged fairly easily when examining the data and the methodology of Google Trends allowed for patterns to stick out better due to normalization. I am very pleased with the conclusions I was able to draw from the data, such as the hypothesis that students are the ones most likely to search about residential schools, and communities with higher percentages of Indigenous population are more likely to be searching for information on residential schools.</p>
