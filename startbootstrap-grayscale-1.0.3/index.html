                    <h2>Timeline</h2>
                    <P>One of the most important aspects of analyzing the public consciousness on residential schools is to see how that consciousness plays out over time. Some very interesting things reveal themselves when trends are examined over a longer period of time. With this information, we can roughly gauge who is searching for residential schools the most, and what events have triggered this.</P><br>

  <p>The first thing that needs to be discussed is who is searching for residential schools: with close examination of this graph and some basic inference, we can discover that fairly easily. Looking at this timeline, one can see there is a general fluctuation in search patterns from 2004 to the present: there may be a rise in discussion of residential schools for the better part of a year, but there are numerous dips within each year. While the search activity from year to year can differ, these periods of search inactivity persist.</p>
  <p>If one mouses over the lower portions of the graph, the months they represent are July, August, January and December. Furthermore, the dips in July and August are significantly larger than those during January and December. These dates correspond to the Canadian public school schedule, with two months off in the summer (July and August) and several weeks off for Christmas and New Years (December and January). It is clear to see that the people who are searching the most for residential schools on Google are students!</p>
  <p>What can we draw from this then, on a historical basis? We can assume that student assignments based around residential schools are part of the curriculum and therefore not entirely dependent on political events, such as Harper's apology or the TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission). While Harper's apology does make a spike in search frequency, if one looks to June of 2008, or discussion of compensation, if one looks at November of 2004 or 2005, searches are still made during the year on a schedule that is largely consistent with the school year. This latter discussion of compensation may not be linked to the search frequencies in these periods at all: instead, it may be the time of year that teachers generally introduce discussion of residential schools. This would be consistent with the general pattern of discussion on residential schools peaking in November and March or April respectively, both of which are in the middle of each half of the school year.</p>

                <p>This next section will discuss where in particular people are searching for information of residential schools, as opposed to when and who. In the previous section, we discovered from patterns in the timeline that the people who were engaging most with residential schools through Google searches were students. Where are these students searching most frequently for information on residential schools?</p>

<p>In order for us to understand what these numbers mean, we must contextualize them. In Google Trends, search numbers are normalized against the total number of searches in a given time and area. Thus, these figures don't show that the Northwest Territories have the largest population searching about residential schools in Canada, but rather that there are less people making Google searches about other topics. Considering the population of the Northwest Territories in 2011 was 41,462, while the population of the second most represented province, Saskatchewan, in 2011 was 1,033,381, clearly one can see that Google's algorithms have altered the visualization by their method of conceiving numbers. The same kind of skewed visualization is seen in the figures below, as well.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.ca/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&geo=CA&q=residential+schools&cmpt=q&tz&content=1&cid=GEO_MAP_0_1&export=5&w=500&h=420">

    <br>
  <p>So, in order to discover where discourse on residential schools has been going on the most, we have to turn to a representation of discussion in each province over time. Below, I have included an animated GIF showing a progression of residential school's search frequency in each province over time. It shows that, for the most part, discussion is centred around the prairies and the West Coast, is nominally discussed in central Canada, and is ignored almost entirely in the East.</p>
  <center><img src="http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/4-04-2015/6FYoG7.gif" alt="Changes in search frequencies for residential schools, 2004 to present. Made with Google Trends and makeagif.com"></center><br>
  <p> The most obvious element of this visualization is its incongruence with the line graph, also provided by Google, but there is an explanation for this. The shade of each province is relative to the others over the period of time, and Google normalizes their numbers in a way that can convolute information a bit. Thus, this picture is being used to show diversions in particular provinces from the search patterns of the majority of provinces. With that said, the emphasis on searching about residential schools in the prairie provinces can also be seen in another timeline, this one comparing Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Ontario.</p>
<center>
    <div style="width:650px; height:330px; background-color:white">
        <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.ca/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=residential+schools&geo=CA-ON,+CA-SK,+CA-AB,+CA-MB,+CA-BC&cmpt=geo&tz&tz&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=650&h=330">
            
        </script></div></center><br>
<p>After 2007, the search frequencies of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to a lesser degree at points, Manitoba, are much higher than those of British Columbia and Ontario. Why is that? One answer could be the differences in Indigenous populations in each province. While Ontario has 441,395 Indigenous people out of a total population of 12,651,795, 3.4% of the total population, Saskatchewan has 121,465 out of a total population of 1,008,760,  16% of the population. Similarly high, Manitoba's Indigenous population is 15.8% of the total population, and Alberta's is 5.8% - still low but considerably larger than that of Ontario. CITE THESE???</p>
 <p>Seeing as Ontario's Indigenous population is the relative lowest, despite being the highest population province in general, it makes sense that the prairies, with a much higher Indigenous population relatively, would have more search frequency than central Canada. Similarly, as mentioned earlier towards the Northwest Territories, 50.3% of people in the area are Indigenous, either First Nations, Metis, or Inuit, which explains the higher frequencies of search in areas where there are not as many people to search things in general.</p>
<p>Thus the general trend we are seeing here is showing that along with being generally attributed to students, there is an emphasis on searching about residential schools in provinces with higher Indigenous populations relative to the total populations. This trend is also replicated in cities within the prairie provinces, as illustrated by the figures below.</p>

<p>In Saskatchewan, the city with the highest search frequency out of the three that have enough frequency to appear is Prince Albert, as opposed to Regina and Saskatoon. While Regina and Saskatoon had, in 2011, populations of 193,100 and 222,189 respectively, Prince Albert only had 35,129. However, the percentage of the population in Prince Albert who are Indigenous, either First Nation or Metis, is 41.5%, compared to 9.9% and 9.7% respectively.</p>
<p>A similar pattern emerges in Ontario, despite it's low Indigenous population relative to the total population. In Thunder Bay and Greater Sudbury, the Indigenous populations account for 8.2% and 6.9% of the total populations, high for Ontario (Peterborough is an outlier in this case, with only 2.3% of the total population being Indigenous.) This is juxtaposed with the low Indigeous populations in more southern Ontario cities, such as London with 1.9% of the total population, and St. Catharines, with 1.6%.</p>
