  <title>Public Consciousness of Residential Schools through Google Trends - Timeline</title>
</head>

<body>
  <P>One of the most important aspects of analyzing the public consciousness on residential schools is to see how that consciousness plays out over time. Some very interesting things reveal themselves when trends are examined over a longer period of time. With this information, we can roughly gauge who is searching for residential schools the most, and what events have triggered this.</P>
  <p><script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.ca/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&geo=CA&q=residential+schools&cmpt=q&tz&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=900&h=430"></script></p>
  <p>The first thing that needs to be discussed is who is searching for residential schools: with close examination of this graph and some basic inference, we can discover that fairly easily. Looking at this timeline, one can see there is a general fluctuation in search patterns from 2004 to the present: there may be a rise in discussion of residential schools for the better part of a year, but there are numerous dips within each year. While the search activity from year to year can differ, these periods of search inactivity persist.</p>
  <p>If one mouses over the lower portions of the graph, the months they represent are July, August, January and December. Furthermore, the dips in July and August are significantly larger than those during January and December. These dates correspond to the Canadian public school schedule, with two months off in the summer (July and August) and several weeks off for Christmas and New Years (December and January). It is clear to see that the people who are searching the most for residential schools on Google are students!</p>
  <p>What can we draw from this then, on a historical basis? We can assume that student assignments based around residential schools are part of the curriculum and therefore not entirely dependent on political events, such as Harper's apology or the TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission). While Harper's apology does make a spike in search frequency, if one looks to June of 2008, or discussion of compensation, if one looks at November of 2004 or 2005, searches are still made during the year on a schedule that is largely consistent with the school year. This latter discussion of compensation may not be linked to the search frequencies in these periods at all: instead, it may be the time of year that teachers generally introduce discussion of residential schools. This would be consistent with the general pattern of discussion on residential schools peaking in November and March or April respectively, both of which are in the middle of each half of the school year.</p>

  <p>Finally, here is a change over time of the frequency of search as represented provincially.</p>
